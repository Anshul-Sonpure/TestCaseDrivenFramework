# _TestCaseDrivenFramework_
## Some sort of work that I already worked with "BUT" implemented using UFT.\
Trying my hands on using selenium and Apache POI. So actually I'm working on execution of testcase directly picked up from excel.\
We have an excel under test/resources, this excel will have test case name and test steps(So basically single excel can be used by manual tester for writing testcases
and same can be used to automate testcases and execute the test cases based on execution).\
Partially it's working, but still head hunting on how to improve the code.
As said earlier as well, suggestion and comments are always Welcomed.
