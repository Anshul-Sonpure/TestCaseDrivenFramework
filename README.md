# _Test Case Driven Framework_
## In this repo I have tried to implement an approach which can be beneficial for both manual and Automation tester.

I have implemented this approach using selenium and Apache POI.\
I was working on functional testing and had to write test cases in Excel(tideous and boring).\
And then I had to automate all those test-cases,so I came up with this approach 
where the execution of testcase are directly picked up from excel.\
We have an excel under test/resources, this excel will have test case name and test steps(So basically single excel can be used by manual tester for writing testcases
and same can be used to automate testcases and execute the test cases based on runmode).\
It is working as expected but still head hunting on how to improve the code.
As said earlier as well, suggestion and comments are always Welcomed.
